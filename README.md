##Employee Churn Analysis Project

Overview

Welcome to the Employee Churn Analysis Project! This project aims to provide insights into employee turnover using a combination of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) models, and clustering techniques. Additionally, we've developed a user-friendly app with Streamlit for interactive data exploration and model predictions.

Project Structure

HR_Dataset.csv: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
Churn_Prediction_Student_Notebook_V4_09_12_2023_LAST.ipynb: Colab notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
SVC_model_2, rf2_model, xgb_classifier: Saved models that can be loaded for predictions or further training.
app: Source code for the Streamlit app.
project2_app1.py: about page.
project2_app2modelM.py: the main page for the app.
requirements.txt: Dependencies required for running the app.

Getting Started

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-churn-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd employee-churn-analysis
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app/app.py
Access the app in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

Streamlit App

The Streamlit app allows users to interactively explore the dataset and obtain predictions from the trained models. Simply run the app using the provided instructions in the app directory.

Models

The models directory contains pre-trained models that can be loaded for predictions or further fine-tuning. Refer to the notebooks for details on how these models were trained.

Contributing
